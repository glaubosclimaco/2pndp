#  2-path network design problem
Source-code for 2-path network design problem solution methods

Let G = ( V, E) be a connected undirected graph , where V is the set of nodes and E denotes the set of edges. A 2- path between nodes (s,t) is a sequence of a most two edges connecting them. Given a non-negative weight function associated with edges of G and a set D of origin- destination pairs of nodes, the 2-path network design problem (2PNDP) consists in finding a minimum weighted subset of edges containing a 2-path between the extremities of every origin-destination pair in D. Applications can be found in the design of communication networks , in which paths with few edges are sought to enforce high reliability and small delays.
